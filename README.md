# Setup
1. Install the dependencies using ```npm i```
2. Run the project locally using ```npm start```

# Deployment
Currently there is no CI/CD that deploys our website so we must do it manually and another thing to notice is that it's currently hosted on github pages.
So in order to deploy please follow the following:
1. Run in the terminal ```npm run deploy```
2. Go to github Settings tab, Choose 'Pages', and change the Branch to `main` and save it, then change it back to `gh-pages` and save again. (By the way I am not sure if this step is relevant but I do it each time)
3. visit https://avivkal.github.io/ProjectsManager and view the changes
